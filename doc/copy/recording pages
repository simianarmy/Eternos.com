Recording Pages

New Recording:
  Copy under header should explain the purpose of the recording interface
  
  Instructions above recorder app should explain steps taken to create recording.  It's important that the user understand the difference between Audio only and Video/Audio options.  
  User should be instructed to do a quick test recording using the playback feature before recording a long narrative.  
  User should be instructed to wait 3 seconds after the Record button is pushed for the software to "load" before they start their narration.
  
  Steps are:
    1) Allow Flash access to Mic & Camera
    2) Push Record Button (Rec) (should blink red if working)
    3) Wait 3 seconds
    4) Narrate story
    5) Hit Stop button
    6) Hit Play to preview/playback recording
    7) Save to continue
    
Recording Saved page:
  If recording saved on server, page will redirect to new page where user can enter metadata for the recorded message.
  
  Need copy with instructions on Step 2 - entering recording metadata.
  
  Your recording: displays status (processing, complete, error), with link to Start Over.  Clicking on link will delete previous recording and redirect to recorder app page.
  
  Title, time period, etc. same as for Message pages.

  Do we want a description textarea, or wysiwig box here too?
  
  Category: do we need this?  Might be helpful to provide all the major life events as categories in order to simplify tagging requirements...  See choices for examples.
