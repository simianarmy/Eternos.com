Porter Stemming Algorithm
  TagCrowd uses the standard  Porter Stemming Algorithm to detect and combine similar words. For example, the words 'teachers', 'teaching' and 'teach' will all be combined so your text cloud is less redundant. The most frequent of the variants is chosen to represent them all. In the case of a tie, the shorter variant is used.

Since we already use thinking_sphinx to index all text data per user, it makes sense to plugin to their 
indexer for analysis.

thinking-sphinx gem uses Riddle internally, which can be configured to take all kinds of things we probably want:
  stopwords
  morphology (PorterStemming?)
  phrase boundaries
  html remove elements
