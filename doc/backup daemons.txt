EventMachine is a library for Ruby, C++, and Java programs. It provides event-driven I/O using the Reactor pattern. EventMachine is designed to simultaneously meet two key needs:

    * Extremely high scalability, performance and stability for the most demanding production environments; and
    * An API that eliminates the complexities of high-performance threaded network programming, allowing engineers to concentrate on their application logic.

ruote
http://openwferu.rubyforge.org/

open source ruby workflow engine
Ruote is a workflow engine written in Ruby. Itâ€™s a runtime for long running [business] processes.
interesting...

Ruote will only benefit you on the publisher side when your process needs
more than "if response == true; job_succeeded; else job_failed; end". Ruote
strengths (for me) lies in the ability to react on the responses. Failures
change the entire course of the process, people get notified, actions have
to be taken. Ruote isn't the right tool to use for "watching a directory"
and "starting processes". It is a decision maker, it calls the shots.
