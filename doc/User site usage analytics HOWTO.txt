Eternos user metrics collection HOWTO.

This document describes every marketing metric and how to obtain the data using the Rails framework.
These stats will be collected and presented to Marketing & Sales Team via visual representations.

Logins: 
  users.last_login_at - timestamp of last login
  users.failed_login_count - count of failed logins (invalid username/password)
  users.login_count - running count of logins
  
# Active Users per 24 hour period:
  Member.last_request_at_gt(24.hours.ago).size

# Emails sent:
  user_mailings db table (you can break it down by type using the 'subject' attribute)

Registrations (Customers who completed the registration process last 31 days):
  = new users.  You can use the named_scope:
 Member.active.size
with extra time parameters to limit the results

Activations (Customers who had activity 3 to 10 days after they registered. Measures only customers that registered the last 31 days):
 = new users who have added 1+ backup site.  You can use the named_scope:
 Member.active.with_sources with date delimiters
 
Activation/Registrations:
  See #s above
  
% Retained 30+ Days:
  % Users that have data sources that are still backing up 30+ days after registration date.
  = Retained 30+ days / Total Actives
  Total Actives = Member.active.with_sources.all.uniq.size
  To find out if a user's data source is still active, check each user's backup sources using the 
  member.backup_sources association
  
  Use backup_sources.latest_day_backed_up db attribute to find the most recent backup date for each backup source.
  Note: backup_source_jobs table contains the most up-to-date details on each backup source's recent backup jobs.  Study it's structure for an idea of how backup job data is stored.
  
% Retained 90+ Days
  = Retained 90+ days / Total Actives
