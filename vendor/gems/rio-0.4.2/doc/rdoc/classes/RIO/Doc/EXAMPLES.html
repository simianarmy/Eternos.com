The following examples are provided without comment
</p>
<pre>
 array = rio('afile').readlines

 rio('afile') &gt; rio('acopy')

 ary = rio('afile').chomp.lines[0...10]

 rio('adir').rename.all.files('*.htm') do |file|
   file.ext = '.html'
 end
</pre>
<p>
A basic familiarity with ruby and shell operations should allow a casual
reader to guess what these examples will do. How they are being performed
may not be what a casual reader might expect. I will explain these example
to illustrate the Rio basics.
</p>
<p>
For many more examples please read the <a href="HOWTO.html">HOWTO</a>
document and the rdoc documentation.
</p>
<h2>Example 1.</h2>
<pre>
 array = rio('afile').readlines
</pre>
<p>
This uses IO#readlines to read the lines of &#8216;afile&#8217; into an
array.
</p>
<h3>Creating a Rio</h3>
<p>
Rio extends the module <a href="../../Kernel.html">Kernel</a> by adding one
function <tt>rio</tt>, which acts as a constructor returning a Rio. This
constructor builds a description of the resource the Rio will access
(usually a path). It does not open the resource, check for its existance,
or do anything except remember its specifcation. <em>rio</em> returns the
Rio which can be chained to a Rio method as in this example or stored in a
variable. This coud have been written
</p>
<pre>
 ario = rio('afile')
 array = ario.readlines

 ario = rio('afile')
</pre>
<p>
In this case the resource specified is a relative path. After the first
line the Rio does know or care whether it is a path to a file nor whether
it exists. Rio provides many methods that only deal with a resource at this
level, much as the standard library classes Pathname and URI. It should be
noted at this point that Rio paths stored internally as a URL as specified
in RFC 1738 and therefore use slashes as separators. A resource can also be
specified without separators, because <em>rio</em> interprets multiple
arguments as parts of a path to be joined, and an array as an array of
parts to be joined. So the following all specify the same resource.
</p>
<pre>
 rio('adir/afile')
 rio('adir','afile')
 rio(%w/adir afile/)
</pre>
<p>
The rio constructor can be used to specify non-file-system resources, but
for this example we will restrict our discussion to paths to entities on
file-systems.
</p>
<pre>
 array = ario.readlines
</pre>
<p>
Now that we have a Rio, we can call one of its methods; in this case
<em>readlines</em>. This is an example of using a Rio as a proxy for the
builtin IO#readlines. Given the method <em>readlines</em>, the Rio opens
&#8216;afile&#8217; for reading, calls readlines on the resulting IO
object, closes the IO object, and returns the lines read.
</p>
<h2>Example 2</h2>
<pre>
 rio('afile') &gt; rio('acopy')
</pre>
<p>
This copies the file &#8216;afile&#8217; into the file &#8216;acopy&#8217;.
</p>
<p>
The first things that happen here are the creation of the Rios. As
described in Example 1, when created a Rio simply remembers the
specifcation of its resource. In this case, a relative path
&#8216;afile&#8217; on the left and a relative path &#8216;acopy&#8217; on
the right.
</p>
<p>
Next the Rio#> (copy-to) method is called on the &#8216;afile&#8217; Rio
with the &#8216;acopy&#8217; Rio as its argument. If that looks like a
greater-than operator to you, think Unix shell, with Rios
&#8217;&gt;&#8217; is the copy-to operator.
</p>
<p>
Upon seeing the copy-to operator, the Rio has all the information it needs
to proceed. It determines that it must be opened for reading, that its
argument must be opened for writing, and that it&#8217;s contents must be
copied to the resource referenced by it&#8217; argument &#8212; and that is
what it does. Then it closes itself and its argument.
</p>
<p>
Consider if we had written this example this way.
</p>
<pre>
 afile = rio('afile')
 acopy = rio('acopy')
 afile &gt; acopy
</pre>
<p>
In this case we would still have variables referencing the Rios, and
perhaps we would like do things a little differently than described above.
Be assured that the selection of mode and automatic closing of files are
the default behaviour and can be changed. Say we wanted &#8216;afile&#8217;
to remain open so that we could rewind it and make a second copy, we might
do something like this:
</p>
<pre>
 afile = rio('afile').nocloseoneof
 afile &gt; rio('acopy1')
 afile.rewind &gt; rio('acopy2')
 afile.close
</pre>
<p>
Actually the &#8216;thinking process&#8217; of the Rio when it sees a
copy-to operator is much more complex than that described above. If its
argument had been a rio referencing a directory, it would not have opened
itself for reading, but instead used FileUtils#cp to copy itself; if its
argument had been a string, its contents would have ended up in the string;
If its argument had been an array, its lines would been elements of that
array; if its argument had been a socket, the its contents would have been
copied to the socket. See the documentation for details.
</p>
<h2>Example 3.</h2>
<pre>
 array = rio('afile').chomp.lines[0...10]
</pre>
<p>
This fills <tt>array</tt> with the first ten lines of &#8216;afile&#8217;,
with each line chomped
</p>
<p>
The casual observer mentioned above might think that <tt>lines</tt> returns
an array of lines and that this is a simple rewording of <tt>array = <a
href="http://0...10">rio('afile').readlines</a></tt> or even of <tt>array =
<a href="http://0...10">File.new('afile').readlines</a></tt>. They would be
wrong.
</p>
<p>
<tt>chomp</tt> is a configuration method which turns on chomp-mode and
returns the Rio. Chomp-mode causes all line oriented read operations to
perform a String#chomp on each line
</p>
<h3>Reading files</h3>
<p>
Rio provides four methods to select which part of the file is read and how
the file is divided. They are <tt>lines</tt>, <tt>records</tt>,
<tt>rows</tt> and <tt>bytes</tt>. Briefly, <tt>lines</tt> specifies that
the file should be read line by line and <tt>bytes(n)</tt> specifies that
the file should be read in <em>n</em> byte chunks. All four take arguments
which can be used to filter lines or chunks in or out. For simple Rios
<tt>records</tt> and <tt>rows</tt> only specify the filter arguments and
are provided for use be extensions. For example, the CSV extension returns
an array of the columns in a line when <tt>records</tt> is used. In the
absence of an extension <tt>records</tt> and <tt>rows</tt> behave like
<tt>lines</tt>.
</p>
<p>
First lets rewrite our example as:
</p>
<pre>
 array = rio('afile').chomp.lines(0...10).to_a
</pre>
<p>
The arguments to lines specify which records are to be read. Arguments are
interpreted based on their class as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Range - interpreted as a range of record numbers to be read

</li>
<li>Integer - interpreted as a one-element range

</li>
<li>RegExp - only matching records are processed

</li>
<li>Symbol - sent to each record, which is processed unless the result is false
or nil

</li>
<li>Proc - called for each record, the record is processed unless the return
value is false or nil

</li>
</ul>
<p>
See the documentation for details and examples.
</p>
<p>
In our example we have specified the Range (0...10). The <tt>lines</tt>
method is just configuring the Rio, it does not trigger any IO operation.
The fact that it was called and the arguments it was called with are stored
away and the Rio is returned for further configuration or an actual IO
operation. When an IO operation is called the Range will be used to limit
processing to the first ten records. For example:
</p>
<pre>
 rio('afile').lines(0...10) { |line| ... }      # block will be called for the first 10 records
 rio('afile').lines[0...10]                     # the first 10 records will be returned in an array
 rio('afile').lines(0...10) &gt; rio('acopy')      # the first 10 records will be copied to 'acopy'
</pre>
<p>
&quot;But wait&quot;, you say, &quot;In our original example the range was
an argument to the subscript operator, not to <tt>lines</tt>&quot;. This
works because the subscript operator processes its arguments as if they had
been arguments to the most-recently-called selection method and then calls
<tt>to_a</tt> on the rio. So our rewrite of the example does precisely the
same thing as the original
</p>
<p>
The big difference between the original example and the
casual-observer&#8217;s solution is that hers creates an array of the
entire contents and only returns the first 10 while the original only puts
10 records into the array.
</p>
<p>
As a sidenote, Rios also have an optimization that can really help in
certain situations. If records are only selected using Ranges, it stops
iterating when it is beyond the point where it could possibly ever match.
This can make a dramatic difference when one is only interested in the
first few lines of very large files.
</p>
<h2>Example 4.</h2>
<pre>
 rio('adir').rename.all.files('*.htm') do |file|
   file.ext = '.html'
 end
</pre>
<p>
This changes the extension of all .htm files below &#8216;adir&#8217; to
&#8217;.html&#8217;
</p>
<p>
First we create the rio as always.
</p>
<p>
Next we process the <tt>rename</tt> method. When used as it is here &#8212;
without arguments &#8212; it just turns on rename-mode and returns the Rio.
</p>
<p>
<tt>all</tt> is another configuration method, which causes directories to
be processed recursively
</p>
<p>
<tt>files</tt> is another configuration method. In example 3 we used
<tt>lines</tt> to select what to process when iterating through a file.
<tt>files</tt> is used to select what to process when iterating through
directories. The arguments to <tt>files</tt> can be the same as those for
<tt>lines</tt> except that Ranges can not be used and globs can.
</p>
<p>
In our example, the argument to <tt>files</tt> is a string which is treated
as a glob. As with <tt>lines</tt>, <tt>files</tt> does not trigger any IO,
it just configures the Rio.
</p>
<h3>There&#8217;s no action</h3>
<p>
The previous examples had something that triggered IO: <tt>readlines</tt>,
<tt>to_a</tt>, <tt>each</tt>, <tt>&gt; (copy-to)</tt>. This example does
not. This example illustrates Rio&#8217;s &#8216;implied each&#8217;. All
the configuration methods will call each for you if a block is given. So,
because a block follows the <tt>files</tt> method, it calls <tt>each</tt>
and passes it the block.
</p>
<p>
Let&#8217;s recap. At this point we have a Rio with a resource specified.
We have configured with a couple of modes, &#8216;rename&#8217;, and
&#8216;all&#8217;, and we have limited the elements we want to process to
entries that are files and match the glob &#8217;*.htm&#8217;.
<tt>each</tt> causes the Rio to open the directory and call the block for
each entry that is both a file and matches the glob. It was also configured
with <tt>all</tt>,so it descends into subdirectories to find further
matches and calles the block for each of them. The argument passed to the
block is a Rio referencing the entry on the file-system.
</p>
<p>
The <em>rename_mode</em> we set has had no effect on our iteration at all,
so why is it there? In general, configuration options that are not
applicable to a Rio are silently ignored, however, for directories some of
them are passed on to the Rios for each entry when iterating. Since
<tt>rename</tt> is one such option, The example could have been written:
</p>
<pre>
 rio('adir').all.files('*.htm') do |file|
   file.rename.ext = '.html'
 end
</pre>
<p>
The rename-with-no-args method affects the behaviour of the <tt>ext=</tt>
option. In this case, setting it for the directory, rather than for each
file in the block seems to make the intent of the code more clear, but that
is a matter of personal taste. See the documentation for more information
on the rename-with-no-args method
