h2. What

RVideo is a Ruby library inspects and processes video and audio files by 
providing an interface to free Unix tools like ffmpeg.

h2. Installing

Installation is a little involved. First, install the gem:

<pre syntax="ruby">sudo gem install rvideo</pre>

Next, install ffmpeg and (possibly) other related libraries. This is
documented elsewhere on the web, and can be a headache. If you are on a Mac,
the Macports build is reasonably good (though not perfect). Install with:

  <pre>sudo port install ffmpeg</pre>

Or, for a better build (recommended), add additional video- and audio-related
libraries, like this:

  <pre>sudo port install ffmpeg +lame +libogg +vorbis +faac +faad +xvid +x264 +a52</pre>
  
Most package management systems include a build of ffmpeg, but many include a
poor build. So you may need to compile from scratch.

If you want to create Flash Video files, also install flvtool2:

  <pre>sudo gem install flvtool2</pre>

Once ffmpeg and RVideo are installed, you're set. 

h2. The basics

<pre>
file = RVideo::Inspector.new(:file => "#{FILE_PATH}/filename.mp4")
file.video_codec  # => mpeg4
file.audio_codec  # => aac
file.resolution   # => 320x240
</pre>

<pre>
command = "ffmpeg -i $input_file -vcodec xvid -s $resolution$ $output_file$"
options = {
  :input_file => "#{FILE_PATH}/filename.mp4", 
  :output_file => "#{FILE_PATH}/processed_file.mp4",
  :resolution => "640x480"
  }

transcoder = RVideo::Transcoder.new

transcoder.execute(command, options)

transcoder.processed.video_codec # => xvid
</pre>

h2. Demonstration of usage

To inspect a file, initialize an RVideo file inspector object. See the 
documentation for details.

A few examples:

<pre>file = RVideo::Inspector.new(:file => "#{APP_ROOT}/files/input.mp4")</pre>
  
<pre>file = RVideo::Inspector.new(:raw_response => @existing_response)</pre>
  
<pre>
file = RVideo::Inspector.new(:file => "#{APP_ROOT}/files/input.mp4",
  :ffmpeg_binary => "#{APP_ROOT}/bin/ffmpeg")
</pre>

<pre>
file.fps        # => "29.97"
file.duration   # => "00:05:23.4"
</pre>

To transcode a video, initialize a Transcoder object.

<pre>transcoder = RVideo::Transcoder.new</pre>

Then pass a command and valid options to the execute method.

<pre>
recipe = "ffmpeg -i $input_file$ -ar 22050 -ab 64 -f flv -r 29.97 -s"
recipe += " $resolution$ -y $output_file$"
recipe += "\nflvtool2 -U $output_file$"
begin
  transcoder.execute(recipe, {:input_file => "/path/to/input.mp4",
    :output_file => "/path/to/output.flv", :resolution => "640x360"})
rescue TranscoderError => e
  puts "Unable to transcode file: #{e.class} - #{e.message}"
end
</pre>

If the job succeeds, you can access the metadata of the input and output
files with:

<pre>
transcoder.original     # RVideo::Inspector object
transcoder.processed    # RVideo::Inspector object
</pre>

Even if the file is processed, it may still have problems. RVideo
will populate an errors array if the duration of the processed video
differs from the duration of the original video, or if the processed
file is unreadable.

h2. Contribute

Contribute to RVideo! If you want to help out, there are a few things you can 
do.

* Use, test, and submit bugs/patches
* We need a RVideo::Tools::Mencoder class to add mencoder support.
* Other tool classes would be great - On2, mp4box, Quicktime (?), etc.
* Submit other fixes, features, optimizations, and refactorings

h2. Zencoder (Shameless Plug)

Zencoder is a commercial video transcoder built by Slantwise Design. Zencoder uses RVideo for its video processing, but adds file queuing, distributed transcoding, a web-based transcoder dashboard, and more.
