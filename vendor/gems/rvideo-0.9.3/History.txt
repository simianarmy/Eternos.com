== 0.9.1 2007-10-11

One major enhancement:
* Added Mencoder support. (Andre Medeiros)

Two minor enhancements: 
* Added total_time method to RVideo::Transcoder instances.
* Added another error condition for ffmpeg - codec not found.

Two notes:
* Tried and tested using open3 and open4 for command execution, but mencoder would unexpectedly hang with certain files when using these. Reverted these changes.
* Mencoder has basic unit tests, but needs more tests. In particular, example output should be added for a variety of cases (especially failures and errors).
