= Nifty Generators

A collection of useful Rails generator scripts by Ryan Bates.


== Install

  gem install ryanb-nifty-generators --source=http://gems.github.com

  
== Usage

Once you install the gem, the generators will be available to all Rails
applications on your system. If you run script/generate without any
additional arguments you should see the available generators listed.

To run the generator, go to your rails project directory and call it
using the script/generate or script/destroy command.

  script/generate nifty_scaffold Recipe name:string index new

  
== Included Generators

* nifty_layout: generates generic layout, stylesheet, and helper files.
* nifty_scaffold: generates a controller and optional model/migration.
* nifty_config: generates a config YAML file and loader.

Run the command with the --help option to learn more.

  script/generate nifty_layout --help


== Troubleshooting

*I get "undefined method 'title'" error for nifty_scaffold.*

Try running nifty_layout too, that will generate this helper method. Or
you can just change the templates to whatever approach you prefer for
setting the title.


*Forms don't work for nifty_scaffold.*

Try restarting your development server. Sometimes it doesn't detect the
change in the routing.


*The tests/specs don't work for nifty_scaffold.*

Make sure you have mocha installed and require it in your spec/test helper.

  gem install mocha
  
  # in spec_helper.rb
  config.mock_with :mocha
  
  # in test_helper.rb
  require 'mocha'

Also, make sure you're using edge rails (or 2.1 when released) as some methods require that.


== Development

If you wish the generators behaved differently, please consider
forking the project and modifying to your heart's content.
