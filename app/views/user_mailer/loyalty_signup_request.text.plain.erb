Hello <%= @name %>

On behalf of the Eternos team, I'd like to thank you for using Eternos.com -
We appreciate your patronage. Eternos was founded in 2008 with a mission of giving
the world a free tool for ensuring life stories live on for the benefit of loved ones. At 
our core, we're still a service that automatically archives your important social web 
interaction and email. Whether you reference and reflect upon your archive, or you 
choose to share it with future generations of loved ones, Eternos is about your peace 
of mind.

Since we launched, our operating costs have gone up, data storage and hosting costs
money. At this time, we're asking our valued beta users to visit the link below and
subscribe at the low rate of $2.99 per month (a 50% discount over our $5.99 a month
new user plan). For the price of one cheeseburger every month, you can rest easy
knowing your social web activity, media, and gmail is safe and secure for for future generations
to come!
