I just signed up for Eternos, a revolutionary service for logging your life. Eternos is a completely private and secure life chronicle where you can save life's precious and important interactions, files, memories, moments and set them to a timeline for future enjoyment and reference. Eternos currently supports the automatic logging of Facebook activity, Tweets, Blog posts/RSS, Picasa albums, as well as Gmail.
