<p>
When you choose Eternos Vault, you choose reliability, cost savings and ease of use.
</p>
<p>
Since going live in early 2009, Eternos (our consumer targeted archiving solution) has 
delivered 100 percent up-time and zero data loss. You simply can?t get reliability any 
better than that.
</p>
<p>
At just $9.99 a month, it?s a small investment in important protection you need to have.
And the system is so simple to use, you?ll hardly have to give it a thought. And that?s the
whole idea. We take the time, expense and worry out of the process.
