		<h3>Sync.eternos Summary</h3>
		<p>Founded in November 2008, Backupify is the only online data backup and storage provider that enables users to backup their cloud accounts seamlessly to the Amazon S3 cloud, which has a great security and data duplication policy. As more and more data and applications move from PCs and local networks to the cloud, there is a clear need for a new category of data management services targeting data in the cloud. </p>
		<p>Backupify is the leader in this emerging market. Much of the data users generate today is not stored on personal computers; users have data locked up in Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, Google Docs, Basecamp and other online services. Backupify is not just about backup, it is about users controlling data independently instead of having it stored in hundreds of services all around the web. </p>
