<div class="content-box about">
<p>Eternos was founded in 2008 by several technology professionals who were dissatisfied with existing solutions for long-term archiving of an individual’s social web activity.</p> 

			<p>Most of the solutions available today are manual and labor intensive; there is no guarantee for long-term preservation of a person’s digital assets. </p> 
			<p>This gave birth to the idea of Eternos, a premium life archive service that allows you to automatically import data from 
			Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, Picasa Web Albums, Blogs, and RSS feeds</p> 
			<p>By archiving the things you already do on the web, Eternos empowers you to effortlessly document your online life for future reference and peace of mind.</p> 
 
			<h2 class="myBox">Our mission is to provide our users with tools that allow for easy chronicling of their life and times. Our aim is to offer a 3 generation guarantee for data, ensuring that digital assets can survive for future generations.</h2>
