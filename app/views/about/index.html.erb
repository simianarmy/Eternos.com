			<h1>About Eternos</h1>
			<p>We founded Eternos in 2008 after becoming dissatisfied with existing solutions for preserving the stories and moments that make up the rich tapestry of each person's life. We are pleased to offer you a premium life logging service which automatically imports data from your Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, Blogs and RSS feeds. By logging the things you already do on the web, Eternos empowers you to effortlessly document your legacy for descendants which we preserve for future generations.

      Is it secure? Yes. Eternos.com is a certified McAfee SECURE site. Sites which are McAfee SECURE are tested daily to pass all external vulnerability audit recommendations of the Department of Homeland Security's National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC), the SANS/FBI Top 20 Internet Security Vulnerabilities list as well as the vulnerability audit requirements of Visa's CISP and AIS, MasterCard's SDP, American Express' DSS and Discover Card's DISC security standards.</p>

			<h2>Eternos is a service which gives you tools to easily chronicle your life for posterity. Our aim is nothing short of revolutionary - to allow you a measure of immortality by permanently preserving the rich tapestry of your life. We are not a social network, rather, Eternos is a safe place for you to store all that can be digitized...the events, memories, experiences, insight, wisdom, and knowledge that define you. We are committed to the continued development of technology that will improve the ease with which your loved one's and descendants can form a more perfect understanding of who you were.
