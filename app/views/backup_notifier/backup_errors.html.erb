Hello <%= name %>

You are receiving this email because the following errors were encountered by Eternos.com
while archiving your data:

<% errors.each do |e| %>
  Account: <%= e.description %>
  
  Error summary: <%= e.short_error %>
  
  --------------
  
<% end %>

In order to fix these errors, you should login to your Eternos.com account and 
navigate to the Account Setup page here <%= account_setup_link %>

You can also remove any accounts that you no longer wish to archive from this page.

Tips on fixing account backup problems:

- Make sure that all the authentication information is correct for all of your 
accounts.  You can always enter your authentication information again & save in case you are not sure.

You will receive a total of 3 error notifications per account.  If no action is taken 
and we continue to encounter errors archiving your accounts, we will simply remove them 
from your list of accounts to backup.
